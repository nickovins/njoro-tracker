# Njoro wa Uba Scene Tracker

Installable phone app for the Njoro wa Uba shoot. It shows which scenes have been shot, on which day, where, and links each day's log sheet.

- **Data:** the Google Sheet "Njoro wa Uba Scene Tracker Data". Each row is one continuity report pasted exactly as sent. The app reads the sheet and parses the reports itself.
- **Offline:** the app and the last reports it loaded stay on the phone.
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages from the `main` branch.

To point the "Add daily report" button at a Google Form, set `FORM_URL` at the top of `app.js`.
