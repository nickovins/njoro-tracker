# Njoro wa Uba Scene Tracker

Installable phone app for the Njoro wa Uba shoot. It shows which scenes have been shot, on which day, where, and links each day's log sheet.

- **Data:** the Google Sheet "Njoro wa Uba Scene Tracker Data". Each row is one continuity report pasted exactly as sent. The app reads the sheet and parses the reports itself.
- **Offline:** the app and the last reports it loaded stay on the phone.
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages from the `main` branch.

Reports pasted one line per row (a paste into a cell that was only selected) are stitched back together by the app. A report posted again for the same shoot day replaces the earlier one; lower rows win.

To point the continuity link at a Google Form, set `FORM_URL` at the top of `app.js`. Form replies are read from the "Form Responses 1" tab and win over the sheet rows.
